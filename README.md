# Introductory material for overlapping generations modeling

This repository contains introductory material for overlapping generations modeling. The materials include chapters from Evans and Debacker (2020) textbook as well as suggestions for computational platforms and tutorial notebooks. Please feel free to comment or submit questions regarding these materials by submitting an issue on this repository and "at"-ing either `@rickecon` or `@jdebacker`. We have provided a copy of the current table of contents of Evans and DeBacker (2020) as well as the bibiography. We hope this book will be published and available by early 2021.

Richard Evans and Jason DeBacker have built overlapping generations models for fiscal policy analysis and trained the respective staff maintainers in the United States, European Commission, and India. Contact OpenRG (experts@openrg.com) if you would like Evans and/or DeBacker to provide a customized training to your organization.
